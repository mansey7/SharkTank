# SharkTank

The game is a side scroller where the player controls a shark, attempting to swim between columns of saweed without hitting them.



The aim of SharkTank is to navigate the shark through the field of seaweed. The player scores one point for each set of seaweed successfully passed.
 The objective was to direct a shark who moves continuously to the right, between sets of Mario-like pipes. If the player touches the seaweed, they lose. The shark briefly swims upward each time that the player taps the screen; if the screen is not tapped, the shark falls because of gravity; each pair of seaweed that he navigates between earns the player a single point.

There is no variation or evolution in gameplay throughout the game, as the pipes always have the same gap between them and there is no end to the running track.
